## Internationalization (i18n)
This site utilizes a simple custom hook to provide i18n support. The hook is called `useI18n` and is located in [/hooks/useI18n.ts](). The hook asynchronously loads a translation file based on language code. Each transaltion file is a JSON with keys such as `"global.open_transcript_modal"` which correspond to the translation of that particular word or phrase. The hook itself relies on a `LanguageContext` (see [/hooks/useLanguageContext.ts]()), which is a simple `Context` that is used at the top level of each translated route:
```jsx
export default function ValPageEn() {
    return (
        <LanguageContext.Provider value={{ language: SupportedLanguages.english }}>
            <ValHome />
        </LanguageContext.Provider>
    );
}
```
