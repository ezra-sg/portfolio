# Internationalization (i18n)
This site utilizes a simple custom hook to provide i18n support. The hook is called `useI18n` and is located in [hooks/useI18n.ts](). The hook relies on a translation file provided by the top-level ancestor based on language code. Each transaltion file is a JSON with keys such as `"global.open_transcript_modal"` which correspond to the translation of that particular word or phrase. The hook itself relies on a `LanguageContext` (see [hooks/useLanguageContext.ts]()), which is a simple `Context` that is used at the top level of each translated route:

```jsx
// app/val/en/page.tsx
import ValHomeEn from './val-home-en';
import en from '@/i18n/en.json' assert { type: 'json' }; // translations file

export default async function ValPageEn() {
    return <ValHomeEn translations={en} />;
}

// app/val/en/val-home-en.tsx
import ValHome from '@/components/val/home/val-home';
import { LanguageContext } from '@/hooks/useLanguageContext';
import { SupportedLanguages } from '@/types/i18n-types';

export default function ValHomeEn({ translations }: { translations: Record<string, string> }) {
    return (
        <LanguageContext.Provider value={{ language: SupportedLanguages.english, translations }}>
            <ValHome />
        </LanguageContext.Provider>
    );
}
```

The `LanguageContext` is then used by the `useI18n` hook to provide the correct translations to the components. The hook is used as follows:

```jsx
export default functgion SomeComponent() {
    const { t } = useI18n();

    return <div>{t('global.some_slug')}</div>;
}

```

In the translation files such as `i18n/en.json`, slugs are arranged alphabetically and the keys are namespaced, e.g. `global.audio_transcript` or `val.hero.author_text_md`. Keys which have markdown values are suffixed with `_md` to indicate that they should be parsed as markdown.
